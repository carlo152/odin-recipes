Follow Recipes to Cook Mexican Food

I created several Mexican food recipes and built a website to showcase them.
While developing the site, I applied my current HTML knowledge by:

Using the (<a>) element with the (href) attribute to add relative links.

Adding images with the (<img>) element and the (src) attribute.

Creating ordered lists (<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>) to organize content.
