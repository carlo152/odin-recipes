Create a website showcasing Mexican food recipes

I created several Mexican food recipes and built a website to showcase them.
While developing the site, I applied my current HTML knowledge by:

Using the (a) element with the (href) attribute to add relative links.

Adding images with the (img) element and the (src) attribute.

Creating ordered lists (ol) and unordered lists (ul) to organize content.
